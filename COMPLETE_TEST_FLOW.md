# 🧪 Complete Testing Flow - ReddyFit v2.0 Clean

## ✅ What You Just Fixed
You updated Firebase Firestore rules to allow authenticated users to write data!

## 📋 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Clear Cache & Reload**
1. Open: https://delightful-sky-0437f100f.2.azurestaticapps.net
2. **Hard Refresh**:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. **Open DevTools Console**: Press `F12` → Console tab

### **Step 2: Fresh Login**
1. If logged in, **logout first**
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete authentication
4. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Creating new user in Firestore with UID: abc123...
   ✅ User created successfully at users/abc123...
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Clean Dashboard**
You should see:
- ✅ **No mock data** (no fake people, posts, etc.)
- ✅ **Welcome banner** with 3 steps (if first-time user)
- ✅ **"v2.0 Clean"** version indicator
- ✅ **Real stats showing 0** (for new user)
- ✅ **Orange badges** saying "Set this!" on empty stats

### **Step 4: Test Settings Save**

**Go to Settings Page:**
1. Click "Settings" in sidebar (or click "Complete Profile" card)
2. Fill in **Personal Information**:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Age: 25
   - Gender: Male
   - Weight: 75 kg
   - Height: 175 cm
3. Switch to **Fitness Profile** tab
4. Fill in:
   - Primary Fitness Goal: "Weight Loss"

5. Click **"Save Changes"** button

**Check Console:**

📝 Saving settings for user: abc123xyz456
📝 Settings data: {fullName: "Test User", age: 25, ...}
📝 Data to save: {fullName: "Test User", age: 25, ...updatedAt: "2025-..."}
✅ Settings saved successfully to users/abc123xyz456
```

**✅ Success = No errors in console**
**❌ Failure = Red error messages**

### **Step 5: Verify Data Persistence**

**Reload the page:**
1. Press `F5` to reload
2. Navigate back to Settings
3. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Settings loaded from users/abc123xyz456
   ```
4. **All your saved data should still be there:**
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Age: 25
   - Weight: 75 kg
   - etc.

### **Step 6: Check Firebase Console**

**Verify data in database:**
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/reddyfit-dcf41/firestore
2. Navigate to `users` collection
3. Find your document (UID like `abc123xyz456`)
4. Should see all your data:
   ```json
   {
     "uid": "abc123xyz456",
     "email": "your@email.com",
     "fullName": "Test User",
     "age": 25,
     "weight": 75,
     "height": 175,
     "fitnessGoal": "weight_loss",
     "currentFitnessLevel": "beginner",
     ...
     "updatedAt": "2025-01-02T..."
   }
   ```

### **Step 7: Test Dashboard Updates**

**Return to dashboard:**
1. Click "Dashboard" in sidebar
2. Your stats should now show real data:
   - Calorie Goal: 2000 (or what you set)

## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Getting Permission Errors
**Console shows:**
```
❌ Error code: permission-denied
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Verify rules are:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
3. Click "Publish"
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Try again

### Issue 2: Data Not Persisting
**Console shows save success but reload shows defaults**

**Solution:**
1. Check if you're logged in with same account
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check Firebase Console to verify data is actually there
4. If data is in Firebase but not loading, check `loadSettings` function

### Issue 3: Still Seeing Mock Data
**Seeing fake people, posts, etc.**

**Solution:**
1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Check for "v2.0 Clean" version text
3. If not there, wait 2-3 minutes for Azure deployment
4. Try incognito window

## 📊 Firebase Rules You Should Have

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection - each user can only read/write their own document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Optional: Add these if you want to use them later
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    match /user_feedback/{feedbackId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
