## ‚ú® What's New

### 1. **Accurate BMR Calculator** üìä

**Fixed & Enhanced:**
- ‚úÖ Now shows **3 accurate metrics** instead of just one:
  - **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Your body's baseline calorie burn
  - **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) - Calories burned including activity
  - **Daily Calorie Target** - Personalized based on your goal

**New Fields Added:**
- **Gender** selector (Male/Female)
  - Males: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
  - Females: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161
- **Activity Level** dropdown:
  - Sedentary (1.2x multiplier)
  - Light (1.375x) - 1-3 days/week
  - Moderate (1.55x) - 3-5 days/week
  - Active (1.725x) - 6-7 days/week
  - Very Active (1.9x) - Physical job

**Smart Calculations:**
- BMR calculated using **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** (most accurate)
- TDEE = BMR √ó Activity Level multiplier
- Daily Calories = TDEE √ó goal modifier:
  - Weight Loss: 80% of TDEE (20% deficit)
  - Muscle Gain: 110% of TDEE (10% surplus)
  - Maintenance: 100% of TDEE
- Protein Target = 2g per kg bodyweight

**Example Calculation:**
```
Male, 25 years, 75kg, 175cm, Moderate activity, Weight Loss goal:

BMR = (10 √ó 75) + (6.25 √ó 175) - (5 √ó 25) + 5 = 1,745 kcal
TDEE = 1,745 √ó 1.55 = 2,705 kcal
Daily Target = 2,705 √ó 0.8 = 2,164 kcal (for weight loss)
Protein = 75 √ó 2 = 150g
```

### 2. **Logout Button in Header** üö™

**Added:**
- Logout button now visible in the **top navigation bar**
- Red text with hover effect
- Easy access from any tab

## üîß Technical Details

### BMR Calculation Formula
```typescript
// Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Most Accurate)
Male: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
Female: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161

Where:
W = Weight in kg
H = Height in cm
A = Age in years
```

### Activity Level Multipliers
```typescript
const multipliers = {
  sedentary: 1.2,        // Desk job, no exercise
  light: 1.375,          // Light exercise 1-3 days/week
  moderate: 1.55,        // Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week
  active: 1.725,         // Heavy exercise 6-7 days/week
  very_active: 1.9       // Athlete or physical job
};

TDEE = BMR √ó multiplier
```

### Goal-Based Calorie Adjustment
```typescript
if (goal includes 'loss' or 'cut') {
  dailyCalories = TDEE √ó 0.8  // 20% deficit
}
else if (goal includes 'gain' or 'bulk') {
  dailyCalories = TDEE √ó 1.1  // 10% surplus
}
else {
  dailyCalories = TDEE  // Maintenance
}
```
