## Understanding Your Results

### Body Fat Percentage (BF%)

**What it means**:
- Your body fat as a percentage of total weight
- Example: 15% BF at 180 lbs = 27 lbs fat, 153 lbs lean mass

**Healthy Ranges**:

| Category | Men | Women |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Essential Fat | 2-5% | 10-13% |
| Athletes | 6-13% | 14-20% |
| Fitness | 14-17% | 21-24% |
| Average | 18-24% | 25-31% |
| Obese | 25%+ | 32%+ |

### Lean Body Mass (LBM)

**What it means**:
- Total weight minus fat weight
- Includes muscle, bone, organs, water
- Goal: Maintain or increase LBM while losing fat

### Quality Control Feedback

After each scan, you'll receive feedback on image quality:

- ‚úÖ **Approved**: Great photos, results are reliable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement**: Photos acceptable but could be better
- ‚ùå **Rejected**: Please retake photos (poor lighting, pose, clothing)

## Reading Your Dashboard

### Stats Overview

**Current Streak**: Consecutive days you've scanned
- üî• 1-7 days: Getting started
- üî•üî• 8-14 days: Building momentum
- üî•üî•üî• 15+ days: Habit formed!

**Best Streak**: Your longest scan streak ever

**Total Scans**: Lifetime scan count

**Total Points**: Competition points (see Social Competition Guide)

### Body Fat % Trend Chart

**View periods**: 14 days, 30 days

**Understanding the chart**:
- **Green line**: Your BF% over time
- **Trend indicator**: "Decreasing" (good for fat loss) or "Increasing"
- **Hover**: See exact BF% and date for each point

**What to look for**:
- Consistent downward trend = successful fat loss
- Flat trend = maintenance phase
- Upward trend = may need to adjust nutrition/training

### Lean Body Mass Trend

**Why it matters**:
- Preserving LBM during fat loss is crucial
- Increasing LBM = building muscle
- Decreasing LBM = losing muscle (not ideal)

**Ideal scenarios**:
1. **Fat Loss**: BF% ‚Üì, LBM stable or ‚Üë
2. **Muscle Gain**: BF% stable or ‚Üì, LBM ‚Üë
3. **Recomp**: BF% ‚Üì, LBM ‚Üë (best of both worlds)

### Daily Log

Track your daily nutrition, workouts, and hydration:

**Nutrition**:
- Add meals and snacks
- Track calories, protein, carbs, fat
- See daily totals vs. AI recommendations

**Workout**:
- Log workout type (strength, cardio, sports)
- Duration and intensity
- Calories burned estimate

**Hydration**:
- Track cups of water (8 oz each)
- Target: 8-12 cups per day
- More if exercising or hot weather

### AI Insights

Each scan generates personalized insights:

**Example insights**:
- "Great progress! BF% down 0.5% this week while maintaining LBM"
- "Consider increasing protein intake to 1g per lb bodyweight"
- "Add 2 strength training sessions this week to build muscle"
- "You're slightly dehydrated - aim for 10 cups water today"

## Daily Scan Best Practices

### Consistency is Key

**Same conditions every time**:
- Time of day (morning recommended)
- Clothing
- Camera position
- Background

**Why?**: Reduces variability, makes trends more accurate

### Don't Scan Daily If...

- You've already scanned today (limit: 1 per day)
- You're dehydrated (drink water first)
- You just ate a large meal (wait 2-3 hours)
- You just exercised (wait 1 hour)

### Understand Natural Fluctuations

**Daily changes are normal**:
- Water retention: ¬±1-2 lbs per day
- Hormonal cycles (women): ¬±2-4 lbs
- Sodium intake: ¬±1-3 lbs
- Carb loading: ¬±1-2 lbs

**Focus on weekly trends**, not daily fluctuations.

### Privacy Settings

Control who can see your scans:

1. Go to **Profile Settings**
2. Under **Privacy**:
   - **Show Email**: Allow others to see your email
   - **Show Scans**: Allow others to view your scan photos
   - **Show Stats**: Allow others to see your BF%, LBM, trends

**Public QR Card**:
- Share your progress with custom URL
- Example: `reddyfit.com/u/john-fit-warrior-2025`
- Rotate slug anytime for privacy

## Tracking Your Progress

### Weekly Check-Ins

**Every Sunday**:
1. Review 7-day trend
2. Calculate weekly averages:
   - Average BF%
   - Average weight
   - Average LBM
3. Adjust nutrition/training if needed

### Monthly Reviews

**Every 30 days**:
1. Review 30-day trend chart
2. Compare photos (1st scan vs. latest scan)
3. Celebrate wins:
   - BF% decrease?
   - LBM increase?
   - Strength gains?
   - How do you feel?

### Goal Setting

**SMART goals**:
- **S**pecific: "Lose 3% body fat"
- **M**easurable: Track BF% weekly
- **A**chievable: 0.5-1% per month
- **R**elevant: Aligns with fitness goals
- **T**ime-bound: "in 12 weeks"

**Example goals**:
- Reduce BF% from 20% ‚Üí 15% (6 months)
- Gain 10 lbs LBM (1 year)
- Maintain 30-day streak (1 month)
- Reach Top 10 on leaderboard (3 months)

## Troubleshooting

### "Image Quality Rejected"

**Fix**:
- Ensure good lighting (natural light is best)
- Stand 6-8 feet from camera
- Wear form-fitting clothing
- Use plain background

### "No Trend Data Available"

**Why**: You need at least 3 scans to see trends

**Fix**: Keep scanning daily, trends will appear after 3+ scans

### "Processing Taking Too Long"

**Normal**: 6-7 minutes

**If longer than 15 minutes**:
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Contact support if still processing after 30 minutes

### "BF% Estimate Seems Off"

**Remember**:
- AI estimates have ¬±2-3% margin of error
- Consistency matters more than absolute accuracy
- Track trends, not individual values
- If consistently off, consider DEXA scan for calibration
