      title: 'AI Body Fat Analysis with Automatic Retries',
      description: `Our AI Body Fat Analysis is now powered by Temporal.io workflows. Instead of fragile one-off API calls, each photo you upload is processed through a resilient pipeline that retries automatically if a service fails or times out. Your images are safely uploaded, analyzed by our advanced AI, results stored, and you get notified instantly when complete. Even if external APIs are slow or networks hiccup, the workflow keeps running until your results are ready. This ensures you never lose progress and can rely on consistent, accurate body fat measurements every time. With Temporal's observable workflows, our team can also monitor success rates in real time, guaranteeing over 99.9% reliability. That means fewer worries for you and more trust in your daily routine.`,

      title: 'Daily Streak Calculations',
      description: `Your progress streak is what keeps you motivated. Every night at midnight UTC, Temporal runs a background workflow that checks your activity logs, validates your daily entries, and updates your streak automatically. Even if you're offline or your phone is turned off, the system still tracks your habits. This eliminates missed streaks due to technical issues and gives you peace of mind that your effort is always recognized. With Temporal, the streak calculation workflow is resilient to failures and can be observed in the dashboard. If a job fails, it automatically retries until complete. You get a seamless experience: wake up every morning with your streak updated, motivating you to keep going. This background automation is one of the biggest reliability upgrades we've shipped.`,

      title: 'Future AgentCupid Matching Workflows',
      description: `AgentCupid is our AI-powered fitness dating and community agent. Behind the scenes, compatibility scoring and match generation are complex, multi-step processes involving AI models, scoring algorithms, and personalization. Temporal workflows let us orchestrate these steps reliably and in sequence, so every match is fair, consistent, and delivered daily without delays. With retries and observability built in, you can trust that matches won't silently fail. In the future, this system will also power onboarding journeys and achievement unlocks, sending you personalized experiences over days and weeks, without requiring developers to hand-code timers or cron jobs. Temporal ensures that Cupid's magic always happens on schedule, creating a trusted, scalable foundation for our social features.`,

      title: 'Meal Plan Generation Automation',
      description: `When AgentRapid launches its advanced nutrition features, meal planning will no longer be just instant suggestionsâ€”it will be handled through a Temporal workflow. That means each request is retried until success, portions and macros are saved reliably, and notifications are sent when your plan is ready. Temporal also allows us to schedule meal plan adjustments in advance: for example, recalculating your macros every Sunday night automatically based on your latest weight and activity. This ensures your nutrition plan evolves with you, without you needing to remember to regenerate it. The result is a reliable, scalable, future-proof meal planning service that adapts as your journey progresses. With Temporal, no meal plan request is ever lost, delayed, or forgotten.`,
