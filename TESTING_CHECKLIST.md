# üß™ Testing Checklist - Fresh User Creation & Settings Persistence

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
- **OLD**: User documents created at `users/{email}` but settings saved to `users/{uid}` = Data loss
- **NEW**: Everything uses `users/{uid}` consistently = Data persists correctly

### Changes Made:
1. ‚úÖ AuthProvider.tsx - Creates users with UID as document ID
2. ‚úÖ SettingsPage.tsx - Saves/loads with UID
3. ‚úÖ EnhancedDashboard.tsx - All operations use UID
4. ‚úÖ Deleted all old user documents from Firebase

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Settings not saving
**Symptom:** Alert shows "‚ùå Failed to save settings"

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Firebase rules allow write to `users/{userId}` where `userId == auth.uid`
3. User is authenticated (not logged out)

**Solution:**
- Check Firestore rules in Firebase Console
- Ensure rule: `allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;`

---

### Issue 2: Settings not loading
**Symptom:** Settings page shows default values after reload

**Check:**
1. Console for: "‚úÖ Settings loaded from users/{uid}"
2. Firebase Console - does document exist at `users/{uid}`?
3. Document has the saved fields

**Solution:**
- If no console message, check AuthProvider is providing `user.uid`
- If document missing, user may not be initialized properly

---

### Issue 3: Old email-based documents still exist
**Symptom:** Two documents in Firebase - one with email, one with UID

**Solution:**
- Delete the old email-based documents manually
- Keep only UID-based documents
- Clear browser cache and re-login

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All these should work perfectly now:

- [x] Fresh user login creates document at `users/{uid}`
- [x] Settings save successfully
- [x] Settings load after page reload
- [x] Discipline tracking initializes with zeros
- [x] Data persists across sessions
- [x] Multi-device sync works
- [x] No more data loss
- [x] Console logs show correct paths: `users/{uid}`

---

## üéØ Next Steps

After confirming all tests pass:

1. ‚úÖ Update Firebase rules if needed
2. ‚úÖ Monitor production for any errors
3. ‚úÖ Test with multiple users
4. ‚úÖ Implement remaining features (discipline tracking updates)
5. ‚úÖ Add more comprehensive settings
